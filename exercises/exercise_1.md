# Exercise 1 - Create a Calculator

1. Create a new folder named `calc_app` in the `demos` folder. Create new file named `app.py` folder.

2. Build a command line program which prompts the user for a command.

    Six Commands:

    - "add" : operation to perform => +
    - "subtract" : operation to perform => -
    - "multiply" : operation to perform => *
    - "divide" : operation to perform => /
    - "clear" - reset current result to 0 - does not have an operand
    - "exit" - that exits program

    Prompt the user for the command and the operand.

    - Enter a command: add
    - Please enter an operand: 10

3. Display the result after each command. For example, if I did an "add" operation:

    - Result: <previous result + 10>

4. If the user types an unknown command, display an error for unknown command, and ask for the next command.
