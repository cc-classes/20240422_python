# Exercise 13

1. Update the Calc App so that when a user loads or saves a history file, the file extension is used to determine if the JSON loader/writer or CSV loader/writer should be used. Use the JSON mechanism when the extension is `.json`, and CSV when the extension is `.csv`.

2. For example, when the use types in the command, `save history.json`, save the file as JSON. When the user types in the command, `save history.csv`, save the file as CSV. Use the same approach for loading the history from the file.
