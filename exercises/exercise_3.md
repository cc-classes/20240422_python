# Exercise 3 - Add Remove Command to the History

1. Add a new command to the calculator named "remove". When the user runs the "remove" command, ask the user for a history entry id. Then remove the history entry from the history list. Do not update the result.

2. When the "clear" command is executed, clear the history.
