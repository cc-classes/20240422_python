# Exercise 4 - Organize the Calculator into Functions

1. Refactor code into functions (at least three functions). Define the functions at the top and in the same file. Remember, we can define functions to eliminate repetitive code and to organize responsibilities.

2. You are free to update your code to use additional syntaxes and other Python features not covered yet, except for classes.
