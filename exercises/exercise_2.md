# Exercise 2 - Capture Calculation History

1. Using the data types and structures we have learned thus far, capture a history of the calculator commands: add, subtract, multiple, divide

    For each history entry, store a unique integer id (do not use external modules, just write some code to generate an id - do the best you can with this), the name of the command, and the operand value typed in. Do not track the result on the history.

2. Add a new command to the calculator named "history". When the user runs the "history" command display a history of the commands.
