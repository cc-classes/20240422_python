# Exercise 11

1. Update the add/subtract/multiply/divide command to accept the command name and operand as part of the single command entry. Do not ask for the operand as a separate input.

2. Use a regular expression and capture groups to extract the name of the command and the operand value. Validate the command and operand are the correct kind of data, then perform the desired operation.

## Bonus

3. Update the remove history entry to accept the remove command and the entry id as a single command.

4. Update the load and save commands to include a file name as part of the command. The file name should load and save from that file.
